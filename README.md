We're going to set up a new site using the Common theme

1. We're going to register this repo as a Hugo module (works like a Go module)
2. We're going to set up an .env file with a Github fine grained token
3. Then we're going to mount the common-theme into this new website
4. Then we're going to look at this minimal implementation and decide what else we want to add.
